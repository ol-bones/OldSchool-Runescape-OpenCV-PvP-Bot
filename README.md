# OldSchool-Runescape-OpenCV-PvP-Bot
Badly written OpenCV pvp bot for osrs

- Creates hotkeys to switch gear in milliseconds and then auto attacks etc
- Code sucks but I wrote it in like an hour with chatgpt
- I Pk'd a decent amount of cheaters with it, general result was that they just cheat even harder and get themselves banned
- Requires a bunch of image templates which can change
